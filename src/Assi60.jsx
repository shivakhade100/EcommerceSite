      info: "Shaniwarwada, once the seat of the Peshwa governance in Pune is a 286-year-old mansion and is one of the finest examples of architecture in the city. It is now one of the most popular tourist destinations in Maharashtra. This grand mansion was built by the Peshwa Bajirao I himself as the residence of the Peshwas. Although the Wada currently covers an area of 625 acres, in its heyday it covered almost the entire area of the city itself. The place never fails to amaze the visitor with its various forts and fountain, and the majestic statue of Baji Rao I that greets the visitor at the entrance of the palace. Although most of the Wada was destroyed by an unexplained fire in 1828, what remains of it is equally thrilling and majestic",
